The cloud.gov.au team creates new user accounts for cloud.gov.au. Currently cloud.gov.au is only available to Digital Transformation Agency(DTA) staff and teams working with the DTA.

You should only request access to cloud.gov.au if you need to join an existing project. If you are starting a new project follow our guide to [setup a new project](/getting_started/new_project/).

To request a cloud.gov.au account send a support request to support@cloud.gov.au using the following template:

``` language-none
G`Day cloud.gov.au team

Could you please create a cloud.gov.au account for me?

email: <your email here>
Mobile number: <your mobile number here>

Regards,

Jane Doe
<your team name here>

```

You should expect to hear from someone from the cloud.gov.au team within 1 working day.

If you need access to an existing project then ask the projects CloudFoundry maintainer. This is usually the Delivery Manager or Tech Lead. If you get stuck you can [send us a support ticket](mailto:support@cloud.gov.au).
